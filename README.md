##Test Score Prediction AI
#Project Overview
#This project uses a simple machine learning model to predict a student's test score based on how many hours they studied and how many hours they slept.
It demonstrates how data can be used to train an AI model and make predictions.

##What the Project Does
#Loads training data from a CSV file
#Trains a Linear Regression machine learning model
#Uses the trained model to predict a test score
#Outputs the prediction based on study time and sleep
##Tools & Technologies Used
#Python
#pandas (for data handling)
#scikit-learn (for machine learning)
#Google Sheets (to create training data)
##How to Run the Project
#Make sure Python is installed on your computer
#Install required libraries:
